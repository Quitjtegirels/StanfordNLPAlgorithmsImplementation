# Stanford NLP Algorithms Implementation

This is a implementation of NLP algorithms which can be found in Jurafsky's and Martin's Speech and Language Processing book, although the algorithms are popular.

## Features

- A mini eliza
- Levensthein distance, and Levensthein dynamic programming
- N-gram model
- Naive Bayes Classifier
- Logistic Regression
- A perceptron given a two propositions, tries to predict their truth value.

1.miniELIZA function:
Parameters: text (string) - the input text to analyze.
Returns: answer (string) - the response generated by the mini ELIZA system.

2.levenshteinDistance function:
Parameters: a (string), b (string) - the two strings for which to calculate the Levenshtein distance.
Returns: The Levenshtein distance between strings a and b.

3.levenshteinMatrix function:
Parameters: a (string), b (string) - the two strings for which to calculate the Levenshtein distance matrix.
Returns: A matrix representing the Levenshtein distances between all substrings of a and b.

4.NgramLanguageModel class:
Methods:
__init__(self, n, k=1): Initializes the N-gram language model with n as the order of the model and k as a smoothing parameter.
train(self, corpus): Trains the model on the provided corpus.
prob(self, word, context): Calculates the probability of a word occurring given a context.
sample(self, context): Samples a word based on the probability distribution given a context.
generate_sentence(self, max_length=20, start_context=None): Generates a sentence using the model.

5.NaiveBayesClassifierMY class:
Methods:
__init__(self): Initializes the Naive Bayes Classifier.
preprocess(self, X): Preprocesses the input data to generate a vocabulary.
train(self, X, y): Trains the classifier on the provided data.
predict(self, X): Predicts the labels for the input data.

6.LogisticRegression class:
Methods:
__init__(self, learning_rate=0.01, num_iterations=1000): Initializes the Logistic Regression model with specified learning rate and number of iterations.
sigmoid(self, z): Computes the sigmoid function.
fit(self, X, y): Fits the model to the input data.
predict(self, X): Predicts the labels for the input data.
scaling_input(self, X, feature): Scales the input features.

7.perceptron function:
Parameters: x1 (int), x2 (int), y (int) - inputs and output for training the perceptron.
Returns: None. The function modifies the weights of the perceptron.
